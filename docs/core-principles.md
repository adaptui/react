# Core Principles

Renderless components follows
[basic concepts from reakit](https://reakit.io/docs/basic-concepts/) to make it
more consisten overall and also composable at the same time, understanding these
concepts are essential to work with components.

### Accessibility

Renderless components are built with a11y in mind from the ground up by strictly
following the [WARIA 1.1 Spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/)
and ensuring each and every component properly supports keyboard and
screen-readers.

## Composable

All of our components are built in a way which provides fully composability
across the board thanks to Reakit's approach to use hooks in order to built
larger components.

## Stylable

Components are crafted in a way that are 100% stylable with any styling
solutions available which makes them great for working as a foundation for any
Design Systems.

## Extensible

With composability comes extensibility, our main goal was to make the components
extensible so that even everyone can built their own Component APIs on top of
our components which enable components to be adoptable in Design Systems
