# Core Principles

AdaptUI React components follows all the
[basic concepts from ariakit](https://reakit.io/docs/basic-concepts/) to make it
more consistent overall and also composable at the same time, understanding these
concepts are essential to work with components.

### Accessibility

AdaptUI React components are built with a11y in mind from the ground up by strictly
following the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/)
and ensuring each and every component properly supports keyboard and
screen-readers.

## Composable

All of our components are built in a way which provides fully composability
across the board thanks to Ariakit's approach to use hooks in order to built
larger components.

## Stylable

Components are crafted in a way that are 100% stylable with any styling
solutions available which makes them a great foundation for any Design Systems.

## Extensible

With composability comes extensibility, our main goal was to make the components
extensible so that even everyone can built their own Component APIs on top of
our components which enable components to be adoptable in Design Systems
