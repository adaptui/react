// Keyboards, Assistive Technologies, and element.click() all produce a "virtual"
// click event. This is a method of inferring such clicks. Every browser except
// IE 11 only sets a zero value of "detail" for click events that are "virtual".
// However, IE 11 uses a zero value for all click events. For IE 11 we rely on
// the quirk that it produces click events that are of type PointerEvent, and
// where only the "virtual" click lacks a pointerType field.
